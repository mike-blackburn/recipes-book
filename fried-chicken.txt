1. Murder a chicken
2. Defeather it with your teeth, making sure to leave the beak intact
3. Plunge the naked bird head first into a thermal spring until done, around 85 hours, assuming you began on a full moon
4. Consume, but beware the angry spirit of the chicken, as it will certainly seek its vengeance
